Human Performance Index Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization

Objective:
Maximize the Human Performance Index (HPI) by optimizing a set of factors that influence human performance in a given environment.

Variables:
Training Hours (TH)			: The number of hours allocated for training activities.
Work-Life Balance (WLB)		: A measure representing the balance between work and personal life.
Job Satisfaction (JS)			: A subjective measure of satisfaction with one's job.
Health and Wellness (HW)		: A composite measure of physical and mental well-being.
Communication Effectiveness (CE)	: The efficiency of communication within the organization.

Constraints:
Training Hours Constraint			: 10≤TH≤40 hours per week.
Work-Life Balance Constraint	: 0≤WLB≤100, where 0 represents poor balance and 100 represents perfect balance.
Job Satisfaction Constraint	: 0≤JS≤100, where 0 represents extreme dissatisfaction and 100 represents extreme satisfaction.
Health and Wellness Constraint		: 0≤HW≤100, where 0 represents poor health and 100 represents excellent health.
Communication Effectiveness Constraint	: 0≤CE≤100, where 0 represents poor communication and 100 represents excellent communication.

HPI Calculation:
HPI = w1 . TH + w2 . WLB + w3 . JS + w4 . HW + w5 . CE

Where:
w1, w2, w3, w4, w5 are weights representing the importance of each factor
The objective is to maximize HPI by adjusting the values of TH,WLB,JS,HW, and CE.

PSO Optimization:
Apply Particle Swarm Optimization to find the optimal values of TH,WLB,JS,HW, and CE that maximize the Human Performance Index.
